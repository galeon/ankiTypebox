An addon for Anki Spaced Repetition Software (http://ankisrs.net. Why: https://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition) that embeds an input text area for users while reviewing notecards. This allows the user to type out multi-line guesses within the client, which is especially useful for programming, math, and science-based notecards.

After installing, try it by adding a new note type (maybe cloned from "Type") with these settings...
